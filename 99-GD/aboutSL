# Supervised Learning
Algo consists of a target/ outcome variable (DV) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (IV). Using tese set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. 
The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.
