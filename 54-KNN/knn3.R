data(glass)
str(glass)
#A data frame with 214 observations, where the problem is to predict the type of glass in terms of
#their oxide content (i.e. Na, Fe, K, etc). The study of classification of types of glass was motivated
#by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence...
#if it is correctly identified!

data("ionosphere")
str(ionosphere)
# This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador. This system consists of a phased
# array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.
# See the paper for more details. The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. "Good" radar
# returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "Bad" returns are
# those that do not; their signals pass through the ionosphere.
# Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose arguments are the time of
# a pulse and the pulse number. There were 17 pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system. Instances in
# this database are described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex values
# returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic signal.
# A data frame with 351 observations on the following 35 variables. The first 34 continuous covariables
# are used for the prediction. The 35th attribute is either g ("good") or b ("bad") according to
# the definition summarized above. This is a binary classification task.
