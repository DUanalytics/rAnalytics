# Cases (a) Sample Size are equal n1 = n1 (b) two sample are not independent but same observations are paired together

# Training Given to same set of Students; Performance Measures before & after training

# Question 3 --------------------------------------------------------------

#Ex. A study was performed to test whether cars get better mileage on premium gas than
#on regular gas. Each of 10 cars was first filled with either regular or premium gas,
#decided by a coin toss, and the mileage for that tank was recorded. The mileage was
#recorded again for the same cars using the other kind of gasoline. We use a paired ttest
#to determine whether cars get significantly better mileage with premium gas
reg = c(16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 22, 27, 25, 27, 28)
prem = c(19, 22, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 26, 28, 32)
t.test(prem,reg,alternative="greater", paired=TRUE)
qt(1-0.05/2,length(reg))
# The results show that the t-statistic is equal to 4.47 > 2.2 and the p-value is 0.00075. Since
#the p-value is very low, we reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence of a
#mean increase in gas mileage between regular and premium gasoline.



# Question : Independent --------------------------------------------------

#Ex. 6 subjects were given a drug (treatment group) and an additional 6 subjects a
#placebo (control group). Their reaction time to a stimulus was measured (in ms). We
#want to perform a two-sample t-test for comparing the means of the treatment and
#control groups.
#Let mu1 be the mean of the population taking medicine and mu2 the mean of the untreated
#population. Here the hypothesis of interest can be expressed as:
#H0: mu1- mu2=0
#Ha: mu1- mu2<0
#Here we will need to include the data for the treatment group in x and the data for the
#control group in y. We will also need to include the options alternative="less", mu=0.
#Finally, we need to decide whether or not the standard deviations are the same in both groups
