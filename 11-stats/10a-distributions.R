?Distributions
# The functions for the density/mass function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function and random variate generation are named in the form dxxx, pxxx, qxxx and rxxx respectively.
#
#Every distribution that R handles has four functions. There is a root name, for example, the root name for the normal distribution is norm. This root is prefixed by one of the letters

# p for "probability", the cumulative distribution function (c. d. f.)
# q for "quantile", the inverse c. d. f.
# d for "density", the density function (p. f. or p. d. f.)
# r for "random", a random variable having the specified distribution

# For the beta distribution see dbeta.
# 
# For the binomial (including Bernoulli) distribution see dbinom.
# 
# For the Cauchy distribution see dcauchy.
# 
# For the chi-squared distribution see dchisq.
# 
# For the exponential distribution see dexp.
# 
# For the F distribution see df.
# 
# For the gamma distribution see dgamma.
# 
# For the geometric distribution see dgeom. (This is also a special case of the negative binomial.)
# 
# For the hypergeometric distribution see dhyper.
# 
# For the log-normal distribution see dlnorm.
# 
# For the multinomial distribution see dmultinom.
# 
# For the negative binomial distribution see dnbinom.
# 
# For the normal distribution see dnorm.
# 
# For the Poisson distribution see dpois.
# 
# For the Student's t distribution see dt.
# 
# For the uniform distribution see dunif.
# 
# For the Weibull distribution see dweibull.
#
# For less common distributions of test statistics see pbirthday, dsignrank, ptukey and dwilcox (and see the ‘See Also’ section of cor.test).
