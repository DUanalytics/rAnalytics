#map2_xxx() (analogous to map_xxx())
# pmap() (with which you can map over howerver many elements you want)
# lmap() (for mapping with funcions that take and return lists)
# imap() (for mapping over a list and its names, just like we did above)
# map_at()/map_if() (functions that allow you to filter which elements get mapped)
