#kmeans plots

df=iris

#Now we will do the actual clustering.

#The cl object contains a number of interesting attributes associated with the model.

cl$size
cl$withinss

#Next we do a bit of data formatting and preparation for subsequent calls to graph the data.  Notice that we add the cluster information back to our original data frame.  This is a good organization of the data and also a requirement for working with ggplot2 which is designed to use data frames.

df$cluster=factor(cl$cluster)
centers=as.data.frame(cl$centers)

#The following graph color codes the points by cluster.  We also add the centers and a semi transparent halo around the center to emphasize the place of the centerâ€¦ and its role in classifying the observations into clusters.
