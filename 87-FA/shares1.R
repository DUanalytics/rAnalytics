# identify the desired ticker symbol, pass 'yahoo' to src for Yahoo!
# Finance, and from and to specify date ranges

# The default behavior for getSymbols is to load data directly into the
# global environment, with the object being named after the loaded ticker
# symbol. This feature may become deprecated in the future, but we exploit
# it now.
